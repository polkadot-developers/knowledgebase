Thank you for making a PR to the knowledge base. Please make sure it follows these short guidelines:

- [ ] Are the audience and objective of the document clear?
- [ ] Is the writing:
  - **Clear**: All jargon defined, explained, or linked to. Best to avoid it.
  - **Precise**: No ambiguous meanings
  - **Concise**: Free of superfluous detail
- [ ] Does it follow our [style guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation-style)?
- [ ] If this is a new page, does the PR include the appropriate infrastructure, e.g. adding the
  page to a sidebar?
- [ ] Build the page. Does it render properly? E.g. no funny lists or formatting.
- [ ] Links should go to rustdocs or devhub articles, not source code.
- [ ] If this PR addresses an issue in the queue, have you referenced it in the description?
