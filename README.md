# Substrate Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base is live on [substrate.io](https://www.substrate.io/). The Knowledge Base empowers developers to make informed design decisions so they can make the most of Substrate and its robust vast set of flexible, powerful capabilities.

This repository holds documentation that goes in the Substrate Knowledge Base. The main website is
hosted in [substrate-cms](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-cms).

If you have feedback or suggestions for improvement, please don't keep quiet about it. You can contact us [via our Riot channels](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#watercooler:matrix.parity.io) or drop a pull request. 

## Structure

All docs are written in markdown format. The most up-to-date docs are in the `current` folder, while
supporting figures and images go in the `assets` folder.

## Contributing

Feel free to add an issue if there is documentation that you'd like to see. See the
[contributing guide](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/knowledge-base/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for guidance on making PRs.

## Directory Structure

The knowledge base has six main categories. These are not meant to be a table of contents or imposed
order in which to read documentation, but rather groups of articles within the same context and for
similar audiences.

1. **Getting Started:** Entry-level documentation. For example dependencies, installation, key
   terms.
1. **Learn Substrate:** Conceptual documentation. Articles about assumptions, key concepts, and
   design decisions in Substrate that will help you make educated decisions about developing your
   chain.
1. **Runtime:** Documentation that goes more in-depth and covers topics specific to runtime
   development like macros, storage, fees, and pallet architecture.
1. **Smart Contracts:** A section dedicated to smart contracts on Substrate.
1. **Integrate:** Documentation about integrating and interacting with your chain for node
   operation, key management, and front-end development.
1. **Advanced:** Sometimes you need more details than just the abstraction. The Advanced section
   contains information about encoding/decoding, consensus, cryptography, etc.
