# Substrate Knowledge Base

This repository holds documentation that goes in the Substrate Knowledge Base. The main website is hosted in [substrate-cms](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-cms).

## Structure

All docs are written in markdown format. The most up-to-date docs are in the `current` folder, while supporting figures and images go in the `assets` folder.

## Contributing

Feel free to add an issue if there is documentation that you'd like to see. See the [contributing guide](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/knowledge-base/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidance on making PRs.

## Directory Structure

The knowledge base has six main categories. These are not meant to be a table of contents or
imposed order in which to read documentation, but rather groups of articles within the same context
and for similar audiences.

1. **Getting Started:** Entry-level documentation. For example dependencies, installation, key
  terms.
1. **Learn Substrate:** Conceptual documentation. Articles about assumptions, key concepts, and
  design decisions in Substrate that will help you make educated decisions about developing your
  chain.
1. **Runtime:** Documentation that goes more in-depth and covers topics specific to runtime
  development like macros, storage, fees, and pallet architecture.
1. **Smart Contracts:** A section dedicated to smart contracts on Substrate.
1. **Integrate:** Documentation about integrating and interacting with your chain for node
  operation, key management, and front-end development.
1. **Advanced:** Sometimes you need more details than just the abstraction. The Advanced section
  contains information about encoding/decoding, consensus, cryptography, etc.
