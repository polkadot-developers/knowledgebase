Substrate is an open source Blockchain framework that is meant to be used by developers around the
world. We need **your** help to make this website more friendly for developers of all languages.

If you can help translate the documentation here into another language, please go to
[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/substrate-developer-hub) and pick a language to get started.

Once your translation gets approved, it will appear on this website!

If you are interested in approving translations from others, please send an email to
<substrate-developer-hub@parity.io>.
