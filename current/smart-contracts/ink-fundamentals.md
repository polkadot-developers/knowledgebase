title: ink! Concepts
---

ink! is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)-based embedded domain specific language
([eDSL](https://wiki.haskell.org/Embedded_domain_specific_language)) for writing
[Wasm](https://webassembly.org/) smart contracts specifically for the [SRML Contracts
module](/current/smart-contracts/contracts-pallet.md).

## Design

The main goals of ink! are correctness, conciseness, and efficiency.

ink! is designed to be as close to the Rust programming language as possible. The language uses
[attribute macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html#attribute-macros) to
tag standard Rust structures into understandable contract components.

```rust
#[ink(...)]
```

Because ink! follows Rust standards, tools like `rustfmt` and `rust-analyzer` already work out of
the box.

### Contract Components

ink! should still feel familiar to developers who have programmed using other modern smart contract
languages. The skeleton of a contract has all of the same components that you might expect:

  * Events
  * Event Topics
  * Storage
  * Constructor Functions
  * Message Functions

### Custom Types

ink! supports custom type definitions needed to interact with the Substrate runtime. By default,
ink! has access to all the [primitive Substrate types](/current/runtime/primitives.md) like
`AccountId`, `Balance`, `Hash`, etc...

You can specify and interact with additional types which may be specific to your Substrate runtime
environment.

### Overflow Safety

Being written in Rust, ink! can provide compile-time overflow/underflow safety. Using a Rust
compiler configuration, you can specify whether you want to support overflowing math, or if you want
contract execution to panic when overflows occur. No need to continually import "Safe Math"
libraries, although Rust also provides [integrated checked, wrapped, and saturated math
functions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u32.html).

> Note: There are some known issues regarding functionality of compiler level overflow checks and
> the resulting size of the Wasm blob. This feature may change or be iterated on in the future.

### Test Environment

ink! provides a built in test environment that can be used to perform off-chain unit testing with
the Rust framework. This makes it simple and easy to ensure that your contract code functions as
expected, without the need for third party testing platforms.

## ink! vs Solidity

Rust is an ideal smart contract language. It is type safe, memory safe, and free of undefined
behaviors. It generates small binaries because it doesnâ€™t include extra bloat, like a garbage
collector, and advanced optimizations and tree shaking remove dead code. Through compiler flags,
Rust can automatically protect against integer overflow.

ink! chooses not to invent a new programming language, but rather adapt a subset of Rust to serve
this purpose. As a result, you gain from all of the tooling and support available to the Rust
ecosystem for free. In addition, as the language develops, ink! will automatically gain access to
new features and functionality, improving how you can write smart contracts in the future.

Here is a brief comparison of features between ink! and Solidity:

|   | ink! | Solidity |
|---|------|----------|
| Virtual Machine | Any Wasm VM | EVM |
| Encoding | Wasm | EVM Byte Code |
| Language | Rust | Standalone |
| Overflow Protection | Enabled by default | None |
| Constructor Functions | Multiple | Single |
| Tooling | Anything that supports Rust | Custom |
| Versioning | Semantic | Semantic |
| Has Metadata? | Yes | Yes |
| Multi-File Project | Planned | Yes |
| Storage Entries | Variable | 256 bits |
| Supported Types | [Docs](/current/advanced/codec.md) | [Docs](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html) |
| Has Interfaces? | Planned (Rust Traits) | Yes |
