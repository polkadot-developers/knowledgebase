The **Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities (FRAME)** is a set of modules
(called pallets) and support libraries that simplify runtime development. Pallets are individual
modules within FRAME that host domain-specific logic.

FRAME provides some helper modules to interact with Substrate Primitives, which provide the
interface to the core client.

## Overview

The following diagram shows the architectural overview of FRAME and its support libraries:

### Pallets

When building with FRAME, the Substrate runtime is composed of several smaller components called
pallets. A pallet contains a set of types, storage items, and functions that define a set of
features and functionality for a runtime.

### System Library

The [System library](https://crates.parity.io/frame_system/index.html) provides
low-level types, storage, and functions for your blockchain. All other pallets depend on the System
library as the basis of your Substrate runtime.

The System library defines all the core types for the Substrate runtime, such as:

- Origin
- Block Number
- Account Id
- Hash
- Header
- Version
- etc...

It also has a number of system-critical storage items, such as:

- Account Nonce
- Block Hash
- Block Number
- Events
- etc...

Finally, it defines a number of low level functions which can access your blockchain storage, verify
the origin of an extrinsic, and more.

### Executive Pallet

The [Executive pallet](https://crates.parity.io/frame_executive/index.html) acts as the
orchestration layer for the runtime. It dispatches incoming extrinsic calls to the respective
pallets in the runtime.

### Support Library

The [FRAME support library](https://crates.parity.io/frame_support/index.html) is a
collection of Rust macros, types, traits, and functions that simplify the development of Substrate
pallets.

The support macros expand at compile time to generate code that is used by the runtime and reduce
boilerplate code for the most common components of a pallet.

### Runtime

The runtime library brings together all these components and pallets. It defines which pallets are
included with your runtime and configures them to work together to compose your final runtime. When
calls are made to your runtime, it uses the Executive pallet to dispatch those calls to the
individual pallets.

## Prebuilt Pallets

Some pallets will be sufficiently general-purpose to be reused in many blockchains. Anyone is free
to write and share useful pallets. There is a collection of popular pallets provided with Substrate.
Let's explore them.

### Assets

The Assets pallet is a simple, secure module for dealing with fungible assets.
