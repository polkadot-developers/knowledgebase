title: Runtime Storage

Runtime storage allows you to store data in your blockchain which can be accessed from your runtime
logic and persists between blocks.

## Storage Items

Your runtime module has access to Substrate storage APIs which allows you to easily store common
storage items:

- [Storage Value](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/master/frame_support/storage/trait.StorageValue.html) -
  A single value.
- [Storage Map](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/master/frame_support/storage/trait.StorageMap.html) -
  A key-value hash map.
- [Storage Linked Map](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/master/frame_support/storage/trait.StorageLinkedMap.html) -
  Similar to a storage map, but allows enumeration of the stored elements.
- [Storage Double Map](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/master/frame_support/storage/trait.StorageDoubleMap.html) -
  An implementation of a map with two keys.

Any value which can be encoded by the [Parity SCALE codec](../advanced/codec) is supported by these
storage APIs.

### Storage Declaration

You can use the `decl_storage!` macro to easily create new runtime storage items. Here is an example
of what it looks like to declare each type of storage item:

```rust
decl_storage! {
	trait Store for Module<T: Trait> as Example {
		pub SomeValue: u64;
		pub SomeMap: map u64 => u64;
		pub SomeLinkedMap: linked_map u64 => u64;
		pub SomeDoubleMap: double_map u64, blake2_256(u64) => u64;
	}
}
```

## Default Value

Substrate allows you to define the default value which is returned when the storage item is not set.
This value is **not** actually stored in the runtime storage, but runtime logic will see this value
during execution.

Here is an example for setting a default value for all items in a map:

```rust
decl_storage! {
	trait Store for Module<T: Trait> as Example {
		pub SomeMap: map u64 => u64 = 1337;
	}
}
```
