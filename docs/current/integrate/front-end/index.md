title: Front-End Template
---

We provide a minimal working Substrate front-end, built with ReactJS and the Polkadot-JS API. This project is meant for quick and easy development of custom user interfaces.

Get the project at:

```
https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template
```

Install the node dependencies with:

```bash
yarn install
```

Run the front end with:

```bash
yarn start
```

Connect to the front-end at [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).

> **Note:** You need to have a local Substrate node running to interact with this UI.
